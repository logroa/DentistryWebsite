								You can also take the online assessment by clicking here to see

								* Some restrictions may apply

								Invisalign® is, in most cases, more affordable than traditional braces and if your insurance covers Orthodontics it will
								usually cover Invisalign as well.

								We also have financing available to help if needed.

								Keep reading to learn more about how Invisalign® can help you or call our office for more information.  Dr. Wagner
								has treated many patients and have achieved amazing results with Invisalign®.  

								Invisalign® straightens your teeth with a series of clear, virtually invisible custom-molded aligners.  Invisalign®. With
								breakthrough technology that lets you have the smile you've always wanted — without the hassle of braces.

								The clear alternative to metal braces.
								By using a series of clear, removable aligners, Invisalign® straightens your teeth with results you'll notice sooner than
								you think. The course of treatment involves changing aligners approximately every two weeks, moving your teeth into
								straighter position step by step, until you have a more beautiful smile. And unlike braces, these clear aligners can be
								removed while you eat and brush your teeth as usual.

								Less treatment time.
								An average Invisalign® course of treatment takes about a year. You'll see Dr. Wagner every 6 to 8 weeks for
								adjustments and to check progress. At regular intervals, you'll receive a new set of custom-molded clear aligners to
								continue the straightening process. The total number of clear aligners is specific to you, determined by Dr. Wagner for
								your course of treatment.

								Clear. And comfortable.
								Since Invisalign® is practically invisible, there's no unwarranted attention to your mouth. In fact, very few people will
								notice at all - unless you tell them. They're comfortable to wear and remove easily when you eat, brush, and floss.

								All across the country, people like you now have great smiles and straighter teeth, thanks to Invisalign®. Why not
								join them?

				                <div class="tab-pane" id="invisalignteen">Here's a quick look at the main steps of your treatment:

								A brief consultation and find out if Invisalign Teen is right for
								you.

								We will take photos, x-rays and impressions of your teeth.

								Those pictures and impressions are digitized. Then, Dr. Wagner
								can use the 3D renderings to precisely plan your tooth
								movements from the beginning to the end of your treatment, in
								order to fix your orthodontic issue(s).

								Based on the precise treatment plan, aligners will be made to
								custom-fit your teeth. The number of aligners changes for each
								person.

								You'll wear your aligners about 20 to 22 hours everyday,
								except to eat, brush, and floss, or go to a special event.

								Approximately every two weeks, you'll swap your old aligners
								for new ones.  The aligners will gently and continuously move
								your teeth until they are in their final prescribed position, all

				                Our primary objective is to help you achieve and maintain
								optimum oral health. Our Preventive Care Services will help you keep smiling for years to come…

				                To understand what happens when your teeth decay, it's helpful to know what's in your mouth
								naturally. Here are a few of the elements:

								Saliva — Your mouth and teeth are constantly bathed in saliva. We never give much thought to our
								spit, but this fluid is remarkable for what it does to help protect our oral health. Saliva keeps teeth and
								other parts of your mouth moist and washes away bits of food. Saliva contains minerals that
								strengthen teeth. It includes buffering agents. They reduce the levels of acid that can decay teeth.
								Saliva also protects against some viruses and bacteria.

								Plaque — Plaque appears as a soft, gooey substance that sticks to the teeth a bit like jam sticks to a
								spoon. It is, in fact, colonies of bacteria, protozoa, mycoplasmas, yeasts and viruses clumping together
								in a  gel-like organic material. Also in the mix are bacteria byproducts, white blood cells, food debris and
								body tissue. Plaque grows when bacteria attach to the tooth and begin multiplying. Plaque starts
								forming immediately after a tooth is cleaned; it takes about an hour for plaque to build up to
								measurable levels. As time goes on, different types of microorganisms appear, and the plaque thickens.

								Calculus — If left alone long enough, plaque absorbs minerals from saliva. These minerals form crystals
								and harden the plaque into calculus. Then new plaque forms on top of existing calculus. This new layer
								can also become hard.

								Bacteria — We have many types of bacteria in our mouths. Some bacteria are good; they help control
								destructive bacteria. When it comes to decay, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli are the bacteria
								that cause the most damage to teeth.

								How Your Teeth Decay

								The bacteria in your mouth need food to live and multiply. When you eat sugary foods and other
								carbohydrates, the bacteria use them as food, too. The bacteria then produce acids that can dissolve
								tooth enamel (outer layer of the tooth).

								It's not just candy and ice cream we're talking about. All carbohydrate foods eventually break down
								into simple sugars. These include glucose and fructose. Some of this process begins in the mouth.

								Foods that break down into simple sugars in the mouth are called fermentable carbohydrates. These
								include the obvious sugary foods, such as cookies, cakes, soft drinks and candy. But they also include
								pretzels, crackers, bananas, potato chips and breakfast cereals.

								Bacteria in your mouth turn the sugars in these foods into acids. These acids begin to dissolve the
								mineral crystals in teeth. The more times you eat each day, the more times your teeth are exposed to
								an acid attack.

								This attack can lead to tooth decay, also known as dental caries. First, the acid begins to dissolve
								calcium and phosphate crystals inside a tooth. A white spot may appear on the enamel in this
								weakened area. But the loss of minerals develops beneath the surface of the enamel. The surface may
								still be smooth.

								At this stage, the tooth can be repaired with the help of fluoride, proteins and minerals (calcium and
								phosphate) in the saliva. The saliva also helps reduce the acid levels from bacteria that attack the tooth.

								Once the decay breaks through the enamel to cause a cavity, the damage is permanent. A dentist must
								clean out the decay and fill the cavity. Left untreated, the decay will get worse. It can destroy a tooth
								all the way through the enamel, through the inside dentin layer and down to the pulp or nerve of the
								tooth. That's why it is important to treat caries at a very early stage, when the process can be reversed.

								Types and Stages of Decay

								Young children can get a type of decay called baby bottle tooth decay or early childhood caries. It
								destroys enamel quickly. This type of decay is common in children who are put to sleep with a bottle of
								milk or juice. The bottle exposes the teeth constantly to carbohydrates through the night. Bacteria can
								grow rapidly and produce acid that decays teeth.

								Decay can become worse if the parent does not clean the child's teeth. It can eat through enamel and
								leave a large cavity in a matter of months.

								In older adults, the exposed roots of teeth can develop cavities. This is called root caries. Older adults
								are more likely to have receding gums caused by years of hard brushing or periodontal disease. They
								also are more likely to have dry mouth (xerostomia). The decrease in saliva results in less protection of
								the teeth. This increases the risk of decay. Many common medicines can cause dry mouth. Be sure to
								ask the doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines cause dry mouth.

								Decay can form beneath fillings or other tooth repairs, such as crowns. Sometimes bacteria and bits of
								food can slip between the tooth and a poorly placed filling or crown. This also can happen if the filling
								cracks or pulls away from the tooth, leaving a gap.

								Preventing Cavities

								Do you or your family members get cavities often? Dental research has found out that certain factors
								can affect your risk of tooth decay. These factors include

								The current number of decayed or filled teeth
								Your fluoride exposure
								Family history of decay
								How well you take care of your teeth
								The amount of saliva and the balance of minerals, enzymes and buffering agents it contains
								How often and what types of foods you eat (especially carbohydrates)
								Ask your dentist about the best ways to reduce your risks and limit dental decay.

								To prevent your teeth from decaying, you can do two things:

								Strengthen your teeth's defenses with fluoride, sealants and agents that contain calcium and
								phosphateions.
								Reduce the number of bacteria in your mouth.
								Fluoride penetrates into teeth. It strengthens them by replacing minerals that acid has destroyed. The
								benefits of fluoride to teeth were first discovered in the 1930s. Dentists started to notice that people
								who drank water that naturally contained fluoride had less tooth decay. In 1945, communities started
								to add fluoride to water supplies. Adding fluoride to water systems has been the most successful cavity
								prevention method to date.

								In the early 1960s, fluoride also began to be added to toothpaste. This also had a major impact on
								cavity prevention. Now almost all toothpastes contain fluoride. Everyone should brush with a fluoride
								toothpaste every day. Dental offices sometimes recommend higher levels of fluoride in toothpastes,
								gels and mouth rinses for both children and adults.

								More recently, agents containing calcium and phosphate have been developed. MI Paste and MI Paste
								Plus both contain Recaldent (the calcium-phosphate ingredient). Your dentist can apply them to your
								teeth. Recaldent also can be found in chewing gum (some Trident products) and toothpaste. These
								agents help prevent and reverse early decay that has not yet led to a cavity.

								Sealants are protective coatings placed over the tops of the back teeth — molars and premolars. They
								block bacteria and acids from sticking in the tiny grooves on the chewing surfaces of these teeth.
								Sealants can be placed in adults and children. Children can have sealants on their baby molars, and also
								on the permanent molars once they come in. Dentists can put sealants on molars with signs of early
								decay, as long as the decay hasn't broken through the enamel.

								You can never get rid of all the bacteria in your mouth. But you can take steps to control bacteria:

								Brush twice a day.
								Floss daily.

								Reduce the number of times each day that you consume fermentable carbohydrates.  Some
								prescription mouthwashes (those that contain chlorhexidine) reduce bacteria in your mouth. This can
								help prevent decay. Chewing sugarless gums, especially those with xylitol, can help reduce bacteria
								levels and increase the flow of saliva.

								Most importantly, visit your dentist regularly. Then the dentist can find any decay early, when it can be
								treated and reversed.

				                <div class="tab-pane" id="crowns">Crowns are an ideal restoration for teeth, which have been broken, or have been weakened by decay
								or a very large filling.  The crown fits right over the remaining part of the tooth, making it strong and
								giving it the shape and contour of a natural tooth. Crowns are sometimes also known as 'caps'.



								Why would I need a crown?
								There are a number of reason. For Instance:  the tooth may have been weakened by having a very
								large filling, you may have discolored fillings and would like to improve the appearance of the tooth,
								you may have had a root canal which will require a crown to protect it.

								What are crowns made of?
								Crowns are made of a variety of materials, and new materials are continually being introduced. Here
								are some of the options available at present:

								Full Porcelain bonded to precious metal: A precious metal base is made and porcelain is then applied in
								layers over it.

								Full Porcelain: These crowns are not as strong as bonded crowns but they can look very natural and
								are most often used for front teeth.

								Precious metal (gold and palladium): These crowns are very strong and  hard wearing, but are usually
								used at the back of the mouth, where they are not visible.

								How is a tooth prepared for a crown?
								Dr. Wagner will prepare the tooth to the ideal shape for the crown. This will involve removing most of
								the outer surface, and leaving a strong inner 'core'. The amount of the tooth removed will be the
								same as the thickness of the crown to be fitted. Once the tooth is shaped, Dr. Wagner will take an
								impression of the prepared tooth. The impressions will be given to the technician, along with any
								other information needed to make the crown.

								Will the crown be noticeable?
								No. The crown will be made to match your other teeth. The shade of the neighbouring teeth will be
								recorded, to make sure that the colour looks natural and matches the surrounding teeth. A temporary
								crown, will be fitted at the end of the first appointment to last until the permanent one is ready. These
								temporary crowns may be more noticeable, but they are only a temporary measure.

								How long does the treatment take?
								At least two visits are needed, the first for the preparation, impression, shade taking and fitting the
								temporary crown, and the second to fit the permanent crown.
								 
								Does it hurt to have a tooth prepared for a crown?
								No. A local anaesthetic is used and the preparation should feel no different to that of a filling. If the
								tooth does not have a nerve, and a post crown is being prepared, then local anaesthetic may not be
								needed.
								 
								How long will a crown last?
								The life of a crown will depend on how well it is looked after. The crown itself cannot decay, but decay
								can start where the edge of the crown joins the tooth. It is very important to keep this area as clean
								as your other teeth, or decay may occur which could endanger the crown. Properly cared for crowns
								will last for many years.

				                <div class="tab-pane" id="sealants">What are dental Sealants?

								A dental sealant (also called a pit and fissure sealant) is a plastic, professionally-applied material that is put
								on the chewing surfaces of back teeth to prevent cavities.

								Sealants provide a physical barrier so that cavity-causing bacteria cannot invade the pits and fissures on
								the chewing surfaces of teeth.

								Why should my child get dental sealants?

								Since the early 1970's, childhood dental caries on smooth tooth surfaces (those without pits and
								fissures) has declined markedly because of widespread exposure to fluorides.  By 1986-1987,
								approximately 90 percent of the decay in children's teeth occurred in tooth surfaces with pits and
								fissures, and almost two-thirds were found on the chewing surfaces alone. Dental sealants have been
								shown to prevent tooth surfaces with pits and fissures. Sealants have been approved for use for many
								years and are recommended by professional health associations and public health agencies.
								agencies.


								When should my child get dental sealants?

								sealants were applied routinely to susceptible tooth surfaces in conjunction sealants were applied
								routinely to susceptible tooth surfaces in conjunction with the appropriate use of fluoride, most tooth
								decay in children could be prevented.


								Second permanent molars erupt into the mouth at about age 12 years. Pit and fissure surfaces of these
								teeth are as susceptible to dental caries as the first permanent molars of younger children. Therefore,
								young teens need to receive dental sealants shortly after the eruption of their second permanent molars.

								Are dental sealants just for kids?

								The potential to develop pit and fissure decay begins early in life, so children and teenagers are obvious
								candidates. But some adults at high risk of decay can benefit from sealants as well. Your dentist can tell
								you if you would benefit from dental sealants.

								Do dental sealants replace fluoride?

								No. Fluorides, such as those used in community water, toothpaste, gels, varnish, and mouthrinse also
								help to prevent decay. Fluoride works best on the smooth surfaces of teeth. The chewing surfaces on the
								back teeth, however, have tiny grooves where decay often begins. Sealants keep cavity-causing bacteria
								out of the grooves by covering them with a safe plastic coating. Sealants and fluorides work together to
								prevent tooth decay.
								</div>
				                <div class="tab-pane" id="rootcanals">WHAT IS ENDODONTIC (ROOT CANAL) TREATMENT?
								It used to be that if a tooth was infected or the nerve in the tooth was dying, the treatment the
								infection can be treated, the injured nerve taken out and the pain associated with such symptoms
								alleviated.

								A common reason for root canal treatment is an infected or abscessed tooth, which may result from a
								deep cavity, periodontal disease, or even a fractured tooth. Sometimes, trauma - like a sharp blow to the
								mouth can result in damage to the pulp of the tooth. Should you have symptoms such as swelling,
								sensitivity to hot and cold or discomfort on touching your tooth, a dentist should be consulted
								immediately.

								Root Canal treatment removes the pulp tissue, which is composed of a nerve and blood supply within
								the tooth. After all the material has been removed from within the root, the canal or canals if it is a
								multi-rooted tooth, are sterilized and sealed with a material that prevents bacteria from reentering.

								Because a root canal removes everything, which feeds the tooth and keeps it alive the tooth will become
								very brittle after a period of time. This time period varies from person to person. It is for that reason
								that the tooth should be restored as quickly as possible and your dentist might recommend that a post
								and a crown be placed as a final restoration. Back teeth are usually crowned or capped shortly after a
								root canal has been performed to prevent the tooth from shattering due to the pressure put on it by
								chewing.

								Root canal work is not uncomfortable, and in some instances can be performed in one visit. The
								discomfort associated with root canal is due to the infection associated with the need for the root canal.
								If there is recurring pain after the root canal has been started, or after it is completed be sure to notify
								your dentist as soon as possible.
								</div>   
				                <div class="tab-pane" id="dentimp">Missing and damaged teeth are a common problem for many people. If you are missing your natural
								teeth you may find that there are other things you miss too. You may miss your natural smile or not
								being able to eat the food you desire. Perhaps your remaining teeth are shifting, or you suffer from
								muscle strain and headaches. It doesn't have to be this way. With dental implants and prosthetic
								solutions, most people can get new teeth that look, feel and function like the real thing.


								What Is An Implant?

								What is an implant and why is it used? An implant is a synthetic metallic root substitute that is placed
								(implanted) in the jawbone. It can be used to either replace a single missing tooth, provide an abutment
								(anchor or retainer) to replace several missing teeth, or be used as a retainer to provide added retention
								to a removable dental appliance - such as a full denture. In fact, if you are missing all of your natural
								teeth, it is possible to have maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) fixed replacements - the
								replacements do not come out and you cannot remove them yourself, even if you want to!

								A dental implant is a small titanium fixture that serves as the replacement for the root portion of a missing
								natural tooth. The implant is placed in the bone of the upper or lower jaw and allowed to bond with the
								bone and serve as an anchor for the replacement tooth. Dental implants can be used to replace a single
								lost tooth or many missing teeth. Implant supported replacement teeth look, feel and function like
								natural teeth. Dental implants are a proven restorative option with a long clinical history. Dental implants
								preserve the integrity of the facial structure and reduce the inconvenience associated with tooth loss.

								Benefits

								Improved Appearance

								When teeth are lost, ongoing shrinkage of the jawbone occurs making the face look older. Dental
								implants can slow or stop this process. Dental implants look and feel like your own natural teeth.

								Improved Comfort

								Dental implants eliminate the pain and discomfort of removable full or partial dentures. Since dentures sit
								on top of the jawbone and gums, continuous shrinkage of  the jaw bone alters the fit of the denture
								resulting in slipping or rocking of the dentures. Exposed nerves and irritation of the gum tissue may add
								to the discomfort.

								Implant supported replacement teeth are like natural teeth because they are anchored securely to your
								jawbone. Gum irritation and the pain of exposed nerves associated with conventional full or partial
								dentures are eliminated.

								Improved Speech

								With ill fitting dentures, the teeth slip and slide around the mouth. The facial muscles become tense in an
								attempt to hold the teeth in place. This often results in mumbling, slurred speech or clicking noises.
								Replacement teeth allow you to speak with confidence in a relaxed and natural tone.

								Eat Better

								Dental implants can restore chewing efficiency comparable to that of natural teeth. This allows you to eat
								your favorite foods with confidence and without pain, enjoy what everyone is eating and not think twice
								about it. A full upper denture covers the palate of the mouth and reduces the ability to taste foods. With
								dental implants, you can have the palate removed from your upper denture so you can taste and enjoy
								your food.

								Convenience

								Dental implants can eliminate the numerous embarrassing inconveniences of removable  partial and full
								dentures. You will eliminate the use of gooey denture adhesives that must be re-applied throughout the
								day. You will no longer need to cover your mouth when you laugh or smile, for fear that your teeth will
								pop out or fall down.

								Protect Your Remaining Natural Teeth

								Dental implants are often more appropriate than a bridge for the replacement of one or more adjacent
								teeth. With conventional bridgework, the teeth surrounding missing teeth must be ground down. Dental
								implants often eliminate the need to modify these teeth, resulting in a conservative, yet esthetic
								restoration.

								How Long Does It Take?

								Two separate events are needed in replacing a missing tooth with an implant. First, there is the surgical
								phase when the implant is placed, and second the prosthetic phase, where the replacement teeth are
								constructed and fixed into the proper position.

								Implant placement procedure involves making a small incision in the gum area where the implant is to be
								placed, preparing a site in the underlying bone, inserting the implant into the prepared site, and closing
								the tissue over the implant with several sutures. This area is left undisturbed for several months - usually
								4 - 6 months. More healing time may be required for more involved situations. This is not uncommon.
								Because the lower jaw is composed of bone that is more dense than the upper jaw, the healing time is
								usually less when an implant is placed in the mandible. This 4 - 6 month healing process is nothing that
								you can feel. It relates only to the slow integration of the implant with your jaw. This integration occurs
								slowly.

								After the healing and integration of the implant the implant placement site is exposed - the gum is cleared
								away from the top of the implant. Dr. Wagner will then fasten (by cement or with internal threads) to the
								implant the appropriate post that will be attached to the crown, bridge, or whatever type of replacement
								is indicated. The implant is held in place by the bone, the post is fastened to the implant and provides
								means to attach the crown (or bridge or whatever is the final replacement needed) to the implant.

								Who Is A Candidate?

								Anyone who is missing one or more of their teeth due to injury, disease or decay, may be a candidate for
								dental implants. If one or a few teeth are missing, dental implants in conjunction with a crown or bridge
								can replace those teeth without loosing more bone. If all or most of your teeth are missing, the dental
								implants may be placed to replace a loose fitting full or partial denture. Adequate bone in your jaw is
								needed to support the implant(s) along with healthy gum tissues that are free of periodontal disease.
								Occasionally, older patients express concern that their age may prevent them from enjoying the benefits
								that dental implants offer. However, health is more of a determining factor than age. If you're healthy
								enough to have a tooth extracted, you're probably healthy enough to receive dental implants. Certain
								chronic diseases may contraindicate implant treatment. Dr. Wagner will determine if you are a candidate
								for dental implants after a careful evaluation of your dental and medical health.

				                <div class="tab-pane" id="dentbridge">If you leave a missing tooth un-replaced, this may cause your
								surrounding teeth to drift out of position. A bridge is used to
								replace one or more missing teeth. A bridge not only makes your

								Bridges are cemented in and are unable to be removed by the
								patient. A bridge is maintained the same way as natural teeth -
								regular flossing, brushing, and visiting your dentist.

								If you are considering a bridge in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area call

				                <div class="tab-pane" id="gumdisease">Each tooth has a natural pocket between the tooth and the gum.  In a healthy state, the depth of
								each pocket is 1-3 millimeters in depth.  There are four stages in gum disease:  Gingivitis, Early
								Perodontitis, Moderate Periodontitis and Advanced Periodontitis.  When gingivitis occurs, the depth
								of the pocket increases to 4 millimeters due to the inflammation of the gum tissue.  Early
								Periodontitis forms a 5 millimeter pocket due to the deterioration of bone around the tooth.  
								Moderate Periodontitis creates a 6 millimeter pocket with moderate bone loss and recession of gum
								tissue.  The disease continues to advance to Advanced Periodontitis creating a 7 millimeter pocket
								and greater due to severe bone and gum tissue loss.  

								At this stage, there is usually severe mobility of the teeth with little therapeutic therapy that will save the
								teeth.  Bone and gum tissue can not be restored, therefore early detection and treatment is imperative in
								order to STOP the gum disease process before it is too late.

								Signs of Periodontal disease

								If you notice any of the following signs, please call and make an appointment with our office as soon as
								possible:

								Gums that bleed when you brush your teeth
								Red, swollen, puffy or tender gums,
								Gums that have pulled away from the teeth
								Bad breath, that just does not want to go away
								Exudate or pus that is between your teeth a loose or several loose teeth
								A change in the way your teeth come together when you close your mouth.  
								Any change in the way your partial dentures fit

								Why can't you just clean my teeth?

								  Periodontal disease is a serious infection. Evidence now links gum disease to a
								   variety of health concerns, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other
								    degenerative diseases that are life threatening. It's not just about your teeth anymore!

								Periodontal disease can be a disfiguring disease. Your gums swell in size and
								    become red and angry looking. They may bleed very readily. Your teeth may
								     shift and dark spaces between your teeth may start showing. The teeth then become loose and
								may need to be removed.

								         Early detection as with other diseases is the key to successful treatment. Dr Wagner or the
								hygienist will routinely perform a gum (periodontal) disease
								   screening exam. This is recommended at least once a year by the American
								  Dental Association. The results of this examination will determine your periodontal status. If you
								have periodontal disease, your treatment will be
								      personalized for you and your level of infection. A routine cleaning is not enough by itself to
								treat periodontal disease.

								  What is Root Planing?

								    Normal tooth cleanings remove plaque and calculus deposits from above the gum line. When
								these deposits extend below the gum line, root planing is necessary.

								                       Root planing is performed with the same tools as normal cleanings, but the
								procedure is more aggressive. Often it is necessary to numb the affected area
								before the procedure. Once the accumulated plaque and calculus have been removed, the gums will heal,
								tightening around the teeth.

								Depending upon the extent of disease found in the examination, root planing
								may be done over several office visits. In this way, your dentist can assess  
								the progress of treatment, and alter tactics if necessary.

								Simply stated, root planing may be considered as an extension of a "routine
								cleaning". A "routine cleaning" is intended to clean harden deposits that form
								above the gums. Over time, these deposits often form below the gums, on the
								roots. It is at this point that we recommend a more therapeutic procedure, called root planing.

								What does it accomplish?

								During this procedure the root surfaces are literally planed. This accomplishes several things:

								1) removes hard deposits and the bacteria they harbor

								2) creates a smooth root surface that is easier to keep clean

								3) reduces infection because the bacteria will not reattach to the smooth surface as readily

								It is unrealistic to consider your therapy as a quick fix.  Each person will respond differently to
								treatment. Future treatment recommendations will be made on the basis of your healing. For
								healing to be maximized it is imperative that you participate in your home care everyday.
